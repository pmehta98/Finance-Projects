# Economic Comparison of Coastal and Landlocked Nations

## Overview
This project compares the economic development of three coastal countries (New Zealand, Egypt, and Bangladesh) and three landlocked countries (Austria, Paraguay, and Chad). The analysis explores the impact of geographic location on key economic indicators, employment distribution, trade, and expenditure patterns.

## Contents
- **Introduction**
  - Overview of selected countries and their economic profiles.
- **Key Indicators Analyzed**
  - GDP and GDP per capita
  - Population and growth rates
  - Employment distribution and sectoral contributions to GDP
  - Education expenditure and its correlation with economic development
  - Defense expenditure trends
  - Trade analysis (imports and exports of goods and services)
- **Methodologies**
  - Comparative analysis using World Bank and IMF data.
  - Visualization of trends across multiple economic dimensions.

## Key Findings
1. **Transition from Agriculture to Service Sectors**
   - Developed countries (Austria and New Zealand) have over 60% employment in the service sector.
   - Developing and underdeveloped nations rely heavily on agriculture.

2. **Employment Rates and Female Labor Force Participation**
   - High female labor force participation correlates with economic development (e.g., Austria and New Zealand).
   - Underdeveloped nations like Chad face challenges such as disguised unemployment.

3. **Education and Defense Expenditures**
   - Higher education expenditure as a percentage of GDP strongly correlates with economic growth.
   - Coastal countries spend more on defense compared to landlocked nations, except in cases of political instability (e.g., Chad).

4. **Impact of Geographic Location**
   - Coastal nations benefit from easier trade access and lower transportation costs.
   - Landlocked countries face higher transport costs, making them reliant on neighboring nations, though success stories like Austria highlight their potential.

## Conclusion
The study emphasizes the role of geographical location, governance, and sectoral focus in shaping economic trajectories. It highlights the challenges faced by landlocked countries and the opportunities coastal nations leverage for growth.
