# Market Timing Analysis of Small-Cap Mutual Funds

## Overview
This project examines the market timing ability of small-cap equity mutual funds. Using regression methodologies with quadratic and dummy specifications, the analysis determines how effectively fund managers timed the market to maximize returns over different investment horizons (1-year, 3-year, and 5-year periods).

## Contents
- **Abstract**
  - Objective of analyzing market timing of small-cap equity mutual funds.
- **Introduction**

  - Rankings of mutual funds based on market timing ability.

## Mutual Funds Analyzed
1. **Axis Small Cap Fund**
2. **SBI Small Cap Fund**
3. **Union Small Cap Fund**
4. **L&T Emerging Businesses Fund**
5. **DSP Small Cap Fund**
6. **Kotak Small Cap Fund**
7. **HDFC Small Cap Fund**

9. **Franklin India Smaller Companies Fund**
10. **Aditya Birla Sun Life Small Cap Fund**
11. **HSBC Small Cap Equity Fund**
12. **Sundaram Small Cap Fund**

## Analysis Highlights
### 1. Regression Methodology
- **Quadratic Regression:** Used to calculate Beta-2 values, indicating timing ability.
- **Dummy Regression:** Analyzed performance relative to market conditions.

### 2. Results
- Axis Small Cap Fund showed positive market timing in the 1-year investment window with a Beta-2 value of 3.51.
- SBI Small Cap Fund demonstrated marginal market timing but yielded negative returns in certain scenarios.
- Over longer periods, none of the funds showed strong market timing ability, with most Beta-2 values being negative.

### 3. Insights
- Small-cap mutual funds are highly sensitive to market volatility.
- Effective market timing in short-term windows does not guarantee positive returns over longer durations.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the challenges of market timing in small-cap mutual funds. While some funds showed promise in specific timeframes, the overall analysis suggests limited timing ability across the board. Investors are advised to approach small-cap funds with a long-term perspective and a high-risk tolerance.
